# Improvement Plan & Roadmap

## Goals

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Code Quality**: Improve test coverage to >80%
2. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation
3. **Performance**: Identify and fix performance bottlenecks
4. **Dependencies**: Update outdated packages

### Medium Term (1-3 Months)
1. **Architecture**: Refactor core modules for better separation
2. **Security**: Security audit and fixes
3. **Developer Experience**: Better error messages and tooling
4. **CI/CD**: Enhanced automation

### Long Term (3+ Months)
1. **Scalability**: Support for distributed processing
2. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging
3. **Standards**: Full compliance with industry best practices

## Human Input Required

### Questions for Maintainers
- [ ] What is the priority: features vs. technical debt?
- [ ] Any specific areas to avoid modifying?
- [ ] Preferred testing approach for new code?

### Known Constraints
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Support both AMD64 and ARM64
- Keep Docker image size optimized

## Autonomous Improvements

OpenCode will work on:
- [ ] Refactoring opportunities
- [ ] Test coverage gaps
- [ ] Documentation improvements
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Code style consistency
- [ ] Dependency updates (patch/minor only)

## Blockers

*[OpenCode will add any blockers that need human resolution]*

---

*This plan evolves. OpenCode updates it based on analysis and progress.*
