Please analyze this codebase and create an AGENTS.md file containing:

1. Build/lint/test commands - especially for running a single test
2. Code style guidelines including imports, formatting, types, naming conventions, error handling, etc.

The file you create will be given to agentic coding agents (such as yourself) that operate in this repository. Make it about 150 lines long.
If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include them.

Instructions:
1. Explore the repository structure to understand the project type
2. Look for configuration files (package.json, pyproject.toml, Makefile, etc.)
3. Identify testing frameworks and how to run single tests
4. Detect linting/formatting tools
5. Document naming conventions and code patterns
6. Check for existing .cursorrules, .cursor/rules/, or .github/copilot-instructions.md
7. Generate a comprehensive AGENTS.md file

Output the AGENTS.md content directly without additional commentary.
